PROBLEM-9

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Example 1:
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1 (0 0 0 1)
4 (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

Program:

import java.util.*;
public class prb9 {
    public static int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int z = x ^ y;
        int res = 0;
        while (z > 0) {
            res++;
            z = z & (z - 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
