PROGRAM 1

You are given N fruits.
The weight of the fruits is represented by an array A.
All those fruits which have the same weight can be sliced in one step.
Task:
Your task is to determine the number of steps to slice all the fruits.

Example 1:
Input: N = 4, A = [3, 6, 7, 7]
Output: 3

Program:

class prb1 {
    public static int slice(int[] a) {
        int n = a.length;
        int t = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int c = 0;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
                if (a[i] == a[j]) {
                    c++;
                }
            }
            if (c <= 1) {
                t++;
            }
        }
        return t;
    }
}
