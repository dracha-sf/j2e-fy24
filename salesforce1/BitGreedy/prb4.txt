PROGRAM 4

You have N pills of characteristic values [a1, a2.....an]
On each day i, you can take the ith pill and increase your health by ai points or Do nothing and take 1 point of
damage
H = H - 1, where H is a value denoting your health.
You die if your health becomes zero. Initially H = V (where V is a value given in the input).
What is the minimum number of pills you should take to survive for N days.

Example 1:
Input: N = 5, V = 1, a = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 3

Program:

public class prb4{
    public static int minPillsToSurvive(int N, int V, int[] a) {
        int pillsTaken = 0;
        int health = V;

        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            if (health <= 0) {
                break; 
            }

            if (a[i] > 1 && health <= 1) {

                pillsTaken++;
                health = a[i] - 1;
            } else if (a[i] > health) {

                pillsTaken++;
                health = a[i];
            }

            health--;
        }

        return pillsTaken;
    }
}
