PROGRAM 9

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are
adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Program:


public class prb9 {
    public static int[] sort(int[] a) {
        int n = a.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                if (a[i] > a[j]) {
                    int t = a[i];
                    a[i] = a[j];
                    a[j] = t;
                }
            }
        }
        return a;
    }
}
