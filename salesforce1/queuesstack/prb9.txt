PROBLEM 9.

WRITE A CLASS STOCKSPANNER WHICH COLLECTS DAILY PRICE QUOTES FOR SOME STOCK, AND
RETURNS THE SPAN OF THAT STOCK'S PRICE FOR THE CURRENT DAY. THE SPAN OF THE STOCK'S PRICE TODAY IS
DEFINED AS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CONSECUTIVE DAYS (STARTING FROM TODAY AND GOING BACKWARDS)
FOR WHICH THE PRICE OF THE STOCK WAS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO TODAY'S PRICE.

Program:

class StockSpanner {
    List<Integer> list; int i;

    public StockSpanner() {
        list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        i = 0;
    }

    public int next(int price) {
        list.add(i, price); 
        int j=i; int count = 0;
        while(list.get(j) <= price){
            if(j==0) {
                count++;
                break;
            }
            else{
                count++; 
                j--;
            }
        }
        i++;
        return count;
    }
}
