/*Problem 2:
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of
the i
th
line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.*/
