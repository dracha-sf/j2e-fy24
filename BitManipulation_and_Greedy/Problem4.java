Question 4:

You have N pills of characteristic values [a1, a2â€¦..an]
On each day i, you can take the ith pill and increase your health by ai points or Do nothing and take 1 point of
damage
H = H - 1, where H is a value denoting your health.
You die if your health becomes zero. Initially H = V (where V is a value given in the input).
What is the minimum number of pills you should take to survive for N days.


Example 1:
Input: N = 5, V = 1, a = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation
In this case, you would need to eat the 1st, 3rd and 5th pills to survive.


Example 2:
Input: N = 5, V = 2, a = [1,3,1,1,3]
Output: 2
