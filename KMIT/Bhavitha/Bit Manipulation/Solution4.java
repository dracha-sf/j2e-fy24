Question 4:
 You have N pills of characteristic values [a1, a2â€¦..an] On each day i, you can take the ith pill and increase your health by ai points or Do nothing and take 1 point of damage H = H - 1, where H is a value denoting your health. You die if your health becomes zero. Initially H = V (where V is a value given in the input). What is the minimum number of pills you should take to survive for N days. Example 1: Input: N = 5, V = 1, a = [1,1,1,1,1] 
Output: 3 
Explanation In this case, you would need to eat the 1st, 3rd and 5th pills to survive. 
Example 2: Input: N = 5, V = 2, a = [1,3,1,1,3] 
Output: 1
