Question 6: Single Number Given an array of integers, every element appears thrice except for one, which occurs once. Find that element that does not appear thrice. NOTE: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

    for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {

        for(int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if(((nums[j] >> i) & 1) == 1) {
                sum++;
                sum %= 3;
