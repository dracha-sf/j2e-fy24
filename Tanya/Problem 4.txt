Problem 4:
A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.
● For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1,
3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if
all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next
permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the
array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger
rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory



Solution:

public class NextPermutation {
    public static void nextPermutation(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Find the first index from right to left where nums[index] < nums[index+1]
        int index = n - 2;
        while (index >= 0 && nums[index] >= nums[index + 1]) {
            index--;
        }
        
        if (index >= 0) {
            // Find the smallest number greater than nums[index] from right to left
            int j = n - 1;
            while (j >= 0 && nums[j] <= nums[index]) {
                j--;
            }
            
            // Swap nums[index] and nums[j]
            swap(nums, index, j);
        }
        
        // Reverse the subarray nums[index+1:]
        reverse(nums, index + 1, n - 1);
    }
    
    private static void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
    
    private static void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            swap(nums, start, end);
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
        
        System.out.println("Original array: " + Arrays.toString(nums));
        nextPermutation(nums);
        System.out.println("Next permutation: " + Arrays.toString(nums));
    }
